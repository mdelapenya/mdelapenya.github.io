I started this blog to share my experience and knowledge being a software engineer since 2003. I'd like to commit mistakes when writing these blog posts, so that you can advice me and I'd learn from them, so please comment and discuss about what you like or dislike.

## This blog is all about:

* Coding.
* Testing. It is coding afterwards!
* Continuous integration and Continuous Delivery. 
* Agile methodologies.
* Open source projects and collaboration.
* Web technologies in general.
